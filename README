Simulbaud simulates baud rates for text output. It launches a new
instances of your shell and delays all output. 

It is useful when for some reason the user would want to delay the
output. For instance, it could be useful when wanting to see how the
text is drawn in fancy text user interface programs, or it could be
used for remembering or for demoing the speed of text-based Internet
and mainframe connections as it was back in the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s.

At the moment Simulbaud uses kqueue i.e. works only on BSD flavors.
You could also compile it with a suitable kqueue wrapper for Linux, or
whatever.
